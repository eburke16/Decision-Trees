# Decision Trees
This repository contains Machine Learning examples of Decision Trees in Python. Decision trees are tree structures containing rules.  The leaf nodes of the tree are the "learned" categories (or threshold values). A path from the root to a leaf node represents a rule.

Assignments from my courses at Johns Hopkins and Columbia University are provided here.  They broken down into two different types of Decision Trees:

<li>Classification trees: </li>
 - Uses rules to classify cases into two or more categories (Rocks vs Mines)
 - Classification trees recursively split the data on a feature value
 - Each split minimizes the cost (also known as the impurity)
 - Cost is commonly measured using the GINI cost function (a measure of the probability of misclassification or 'purity') 
 <li>Regression trees:</li> 
 - Uses rules to group data into target variable ranges (Wine Quality)
 - Also split the data on feature values
 - Minimize cost (impurity). Usually the mean squared error 

Please reach out if I can help answer any questions about these topics or if I can help your organization employ similar tools.
